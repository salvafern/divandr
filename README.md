# EMODnet-Biology-PhaseV

Code and notes for the EMODnet Biology project Phase V, in which our goals will be: 1. To make `DIVAnd` interpolation method available in `R` 2. Create gridded maps (heatmaps) of a specific species (birds? mammals?) 3. Compare the results obtained with `DIVAnd` with other methods available in `R`.

## Installation and configuration

The instructions are given for a machine running under Ubuntu (22.04.3 LTS -- Jammy).

### Installation of R

**Documentation:** <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/JuliaCall/readme/README.html>

``` bash
sudo apt install r-base
```

#### Editor [optional]

If you want to work with an editor, the most widely used is [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Visual Studio Code also comes with various extensions to work with R (REditorSupport, R Debugger, ...).

### Installation of Julia

We suggest to use the `juliaup` tool (<https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup>), which makes easier the installation, upgrade and management of different versions of Julia. On Linux or Mac:

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

The Julia version that will be used can be obtained with the command:

``` bash
juliaup status
```

which gives, in our case:

``` bash
 Default  Channel  Version                 Update 
--------------------------------------------------
          1.10     1.10.0+0.x64.linux.gnu         
          rc       1.10.0+0.x64.linux.gnu         
       *  release  1.10.0+0.x64.linux.gnu 
```

### Installation of Julia in R

In a R session:

``` r
install.packages("JuliaCall")
```

You are asked if you want to use a personal library (type "yes"):

``` r
Warning in install.packages("JuliaCall") :
  'lib = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"' is not writable
Would you like to use a personal library instead? (yes/No/cancel) 
```

#### Tested R versions

-   

    ``` r
    version.string R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)
    nickname       Eye Holes
    ```

-   

    ``` r
    version.string R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)
    nickname       Bird Hippie    
    ```

### Installation of netCDF

R relies on the utility `nc-config` to it has to be installed:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev
```

then the library can be installed:

``` r
install.packages("ncdf4")
```

### Installation of other packages [optional]

No used so far but let's keep it here for the time being.

#### jsonlite

When tested with Visual Studio Code, the editor required to install `jsonlite`

``` r
install.packages("jsonlite")
```

even if the installation may not be a strict requirement.

#### logger

The `logger` package is also installed for the logging purposes.

``` r
install.packages("logger")
```

#### Plotting libraries

In Julia, the plots are create with the `PyPlot` module, which is calling Python `matplotlib` functions. It might be more relevant to use only `R` library for the plotting tasks:

``` r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("ggmap")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
install.packages("rnaturalearthdata")
```

| [terra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html)                         | spatial data analysis with vector and raster data         |

## Configure Julia

You may want to specify the path to the Julia executable with the command `julia_setup`:

``` r
library(JuliaCall)
julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = path.expand("~/.juliaup/bin/"))
```

If successful, this command will give:

``` r
Juliaup configuration is locked by another process, waiting for it to unlock.
Julia version 1.10.0 at location /home/ctroupin/.julia/juliaup/julia-1.10.0+0.x64.linux.gnu/bin will be used.
Loading setup script for JuliaCall...
Finish loading setup script for JuliaCall.
```

so you can test if R is actually going to use the correct Julia executable.

## Install Julia packages

We use the command `julia_install_package_if_needed( )` for the installation.\
Some errors happened with using `julia_install_package( )`.

**Documentation:** <https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/JuliaCall/html/julia_package.html>

``` r
julia_install_package_if_needed("Statistics")
julia_install_package_if_needed("DIVAnd")
julia_install_package_if_needed("NCDatasets")
```

## Loading Julia packages

Before running the `julia_command(" ")`, ensure that the Julia packages are already installed (with the Julia version specified in the variable `JULIA_HOME`).

``` r
julia_command("using Statistics")
```

**Note:** it is also possible to start a Julia session within `R`:

``` r
system("julia")
```

### NCDatasets

I might be necessary to issue this command **before** starting the `R` session, in order to ensure the correct `libcurl` is used:

``` bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/home/ctroupin/.julia/juliaup/julia-1.10.0+0.x64.linux.gnu/lib/julia/libcurl.so.4.8.0
```

(with the obvious adaptations in the path and in the library number).

``` r
julia_command("using NCDatasets")
julia_command("using DIVAnd")
```

If the commands worked, the outputs are:

``` r
Precompiling NCDatasets
  2 dependencies successfully precompiled in 5 seconds. 44 already precompiled.
```

and

``` r
Precompiling DIVAnd
  1 dependency successfully precompiled in 4 seconds. 192 already precompiled.
```

## Quick test

``` bash
export LD_PRELOAD=/home/ctroupin/.julia/juliaup/julia-1.10.0+0.x64.linux.gnu/lib/julia/libcurl.so.4.8.0
Rscript DIVAnd_simple_1D.R
```
